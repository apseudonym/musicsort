musicsort
=========

Sort all of your music into nice folders with the click of a button

Requirements:
  -Python 3.4
  -Mutagenx, a Python3 port of mutagen by LordSputnik
  
Use:

  To use, simply run the script. At this point, it automatically sorts music in your music folder, so for windows that's:
  C:\Users\USER\Music
  and for linux users it's
  ~/Music/
  
  At this point, the project assumes a basic organizational structure, ie the albums are at least in their own folder. It sorts music into the folder structure of ARTIST->ALBUM->SONGS
